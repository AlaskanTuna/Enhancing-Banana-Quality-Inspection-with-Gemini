# Enhancing-Banana-Quality-Inspection-with-Gemini
Built on Kaggle. End‑to‑end banana‑quality inspection pipeline that marries a classical Decision‑Tree with Google Gemini Gen‑AI. The notebook auto‑extracts model rules, rewrites them into plain‑English facts, embeds them in a vector DB, and serves grounded JSON answers via a Retrieval‑Augmented‑Generation (RAG) helper.
